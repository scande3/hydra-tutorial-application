h1. Hydra Tutorial Application

This is an example of the Ruby on Rails application that you will create when you follow the steps in the "Get Started Building a Hydra Head":http://hudson.projecthydra.org/job/hydra-head-rails2-plugin/Documentation/file.HOW_TO_GET_STARTED.html tutorial.

See the tutorial for more information about how to recreate this application, how to run it, and how to modify a Rails app like it.

We have created this git repository for two reasons
# provide further documentation to supplement the Hydra Getting Started tutorial
# test the instructions in the tutorial to make sure that they are accurate

h2. Do Not Fork This!

If you want to create a new Hydra Head, _don't fork this git repository_.  Follow the instructions in the "hydra-head plugin documentation":http://hudson.projecthydra.org/job/hydra-head-rails2-plugin/Documentation/
